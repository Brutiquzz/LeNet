# LeNet
A LeNet Model predicting with the following results

Total test samples: 10000 \n
Correctly Predicted Samples: 9883 \n
Falsely Predicted Samples: 117 \n
Overall Accuracy: 98.83% \n
Overall Error: 1.17% \n

A 100% accuracy could ofcourse be achieved with a more modern model but that was not the scope of this project.

The Model was implemented using Pytorch.
