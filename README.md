# LeNet
A LeNet Model predicting with the following results

Total test samples: 10000
Correctly Predicted Samples: 9883
Falsely Predicted Samples: 117
Overall Accuracy: 98.83%
Overall Error: 1.17%

A 100% accuracy could ofcourse be achieved with a more modern model but that was not the scope of this project.

The Model was implemented using Pytorch.
